# webBudget front-end

Welcome to the webBudget project repository! Here you will find the front-end application for the webBudget project.

## Project setup

Like every *JS project, we use node ecosystem and to set up the project, just:

1. `yarn install` - to install all dependencies (just for the first time)
2. `yarn serve` - to run it in development mode

To lint and fix things, just: `yarn lint`

## FAQ

Questions? We try to answer some of them here:

1. Why separate front-end from back-end?
> The answer is simple: flexibility and to let people who don't know about kotlin and all the stuff from the back-end
> work where they are good and productive.

2. Why Vue and not React or even Angular?
> If we have to answer this in one word it should be: simplicity, but is not the only thing, and I will write about it
> on my blog soon.

3. Why VueJS v2 and not v3?
> At the time when the project started, v3 is not "finished", and most of the libs used to boost development process
> didn't offer support for v3 (like Buefy, for example)
